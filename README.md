# steganography_project
The project involves implementing a simple yet effective image steganography technique based 
on LSB (Least Significant Bit) encoding and decoding. Steganography is the science of hiding 
information within other data in a way that does not raise suspicions. In this case, the project 
focuses on hiding messages within the least significant bits of the pixels in an image.
